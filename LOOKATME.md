# DE Challenge by Mario Leon

Hi, this is my take on DE Challenge v2 for Walmart

## Requirements

Dockers service running

## Code Execution

You should be able to run the code provided by using the command:

```bash
    docker-compose up
```

This will build and run the Jupyter Notebook container, submitting a spark job that will output the results to the ```./output/``` folder
